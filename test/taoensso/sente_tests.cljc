  "Due to the complexity of automated browser tests, Sente has
  traditionally been tested manually. Before each release, a suite
  of checks have been done against the reference example project.

  In the hope of eventually doing more of this work automatically,
  the current namespace provided as a groundwork for future automated
  tests.

  PRs very welcome if you'd like to contribute to this effort!"
